Dedicated individual with experience in finance and marketing. Finishing my last semester at DePaul
University online, I am looking for a full time job in marketing. Finishing my classes online during the
weekend gives me flexibility to work. I am excited to enter the workforce and achieve goals as a team,
oppose to a freelancer or intern.
