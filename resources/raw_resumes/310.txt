To whom it may concern:

I am a retired pharmacist seeking an opportunity outside of the health care industry. My personality
and ability to work with and meet new people is a strength in working with the public on a regular
basis. I have worked for the same company for 28 years, holding a variety jobs from customer service
to all management positions. I would entertain almost any position, part time or full time, and
could be available flexible hours and days.
Enclosed is a resume of past positions. I look forward to meeting with you to discuss any needs your
company may have.

Sincerely,


Rodney N. Wilson




To get started right away, just tap any placeholder text (such as this) and start typing.
Wondering what to include in your cover letter? It's a good idea to include key points about why
you're a great fit for the company and the best choice for the specific job. Of course, don't forget
to ask for the interview-but keep it brief! A cover letter shouldn't read like a novel, no matter
how great a plot you've got.
Sincerely,
