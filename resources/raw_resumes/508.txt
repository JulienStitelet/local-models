Dear Personnel Director;
 
Thank you for taking the time to review my resume.
 
My experience includes a 15-year career in the various information technology roles. I have worked several contracted IT jobs for companies such as Apple Inc, Indiana Business College, Conseco, and Cummins Engine.  These assignments were mostly for technical support and deployment of new hardware and software packages.  I was a permanent employee at Conseco and conducted IT project management for them.
 
Conseco provided me with a vast amount of information, as they have purchased over 30 other insurance companies and have to integrate all their technologies to make the company operate.  Conseco can only employ the best of technicians to support their staff of over 3000 employees on the Carmel Campus.  
 
For two years I provided LAN administration services for the marketing department.    Due to the downsizing of their operation I was fortunately able to remain a desktop support tech as well.  With many of the jobs going to India, my future was very uncertain.
 
All of the above job opportunities, combined with my desire to learn new skills, make me the ideal candidate for you current opening.  Please contact me at the number listed below.
 
Again, thank you for your time and consideration.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
 
Chris L. Conway
