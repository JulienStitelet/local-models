Professional experience


10/1/08 - Current:  ADR/Preferred Business Properties - Thousand Oaks

This company hired me to open an office for them in Thousand Oaks.  They
had fifteen buildings they took over management of in this area and
needed someone to take them over immediately. They are a Commercial Real
Estate firm that manages over 100 Properties in the Los Angeles area and
are hoping to expand into the Conejo Valley.  I obtained an office for
them, started a marketing program which consisted of obtaining a mailing
list for property owners in this area and designing and mailing postcards
introducing our services.  I took over the leasing of all fifteen
buildings and have gone to contract on ten deals since January, three of
which were done on a building that had been vacant over three years.  I
have brought three additional deals to the owners that are not under
contract as of yet.  I also took over the day to day management of all
fifteen buildings with over forty tenants.   I work close with the
tenants and vendors in resolving tenant issues and building issues.  I am
a licensed Real Estate Broker and B-1 General Contractor.  To learn more
about this company you can visit their website at www.adrproperties.com.

8/8/86 - 1/31/94  - Asset Manager -  The Sinco Company - Encino, CA

I started with this company as a real estate secretary and within 5 years
I had my Real Estate Sales License, then Brokers License and my B-1
General Contractors License.  I managed, leased and built out over
300,000 square feet of commercial and industrial property.  I negotiated
leases, met with the building departments in several different cities,
pulled permits, built out tenant spaces, collected rents, handled all of
the tenant problems and worked very close with all the vendors and
outside Brokers.
9/13/91 - 12/31/08  - Owner:  The Fulfillment House - Moorpark, CA

I started this company in 1991 and have recently shut it down.  This was
a packaging and bindery company with gross receipts exceeding 1.2 Million
in eight of the sixteen years we owned it.  We leased our first location
for three years, then purchased our own 16,000 sq. ft. building in Vernon
- we built it out to fit our needs - sold it - did a 1031 Exchange for a
building in Glendale.  We then built this building out to fit our needs
and just recently sold it in 2007 when we moved to Thousand Oaks

7/24/94 - Current - Owner:  J.J. Eaton Racing - Thousand Oaks, CA

This is a company that my husband and I started in 1994.  We purchased
several syndications in race horses.  In 1995 we removed ourselves from
the syndications and started this business as a sole proprietor.  In 1999
we purchased a 205 acre farm in Paris, Kentucky to save on our boarding
fees and then sold it in 2001 for a profit.  We still own several
thoroughbred horses and are actively involved in breeding, boarding,
racing and selling of them.

10/15/04 - 10/31/07 - Owner:  Fiji Rental, LLC -  Nadi, Fiji

We purchased a two bedroom two bath suite at a resort on the Fiji Island
of Nadi, with a completion date of June 30, 2007.    Since we were one of
the ten purchasers considered owners we formed this entity for legal
purposes.  The units are still currently under construction.  Due to the
political unrest in the islands we did not go through with the purchase.

4/6/06 - 6/5/06 - Sperry Van Ness Commercial Real Estate

Attended their "Boot Camp" and started at their Woodland Hills branch.
Left to complete the construction of our house in Thousand Oaks.

1/1/05 - 5/30/07 - Partner:  Pro Preferred, LLC - Glendale, CA

This is a sports wear apparel company that was a partnership which we
began in 2005.  The company had several partners who were professional
baseball players at one time.  The logo of this company was challenged
through the patent process by a large corporation, which we had to
resolve through Florida attorneys.  We won the lawsuit, but unfortunately
the apparel market is now saturated with this product and we just didn't
feel it viable to invest any more time or money in it.

9/13/99 - Current  - Owner:  Chadwick Farms, LLC - Thousand Oaks, CA

We purchased a 205 acre farm in Paris, Kentucky and started a horse
operation.  We built a barn, and refurbished several of the other barns
on the property.  We took on boarders and made a good profit.  Once
September 11th occurred, we decided it was too hard to maintain a
business over 2,000 miles away and sold this farm.  We have installed
paddocks and barns on our Thousand Oaks property to continue the
operation of company.  We have also planted over 432 avocado trees to
obtain the agricultural rates on our water and insurance.  We are also
operating this as a business and file annual tax returns for this
entity.

1/31/03 - 12/31/05 - Owner:  Mosquito Wizard, LLC - Vernon, CA

We were the sole distributor for a new mosquito machine "Mega-Catch" that
was brought into the United States from New Zealand.  We warehoused,
shipped and marketed the product.  We introduced the machine at The
National Hardware Show in Chicago in 2003 and were featured on the Danny
Lipford's Home Improvement Show on HGTV.  We were also featured on CBS's
"The Early Show" as one of the top ten products at the National Hardware
Show.  The New Zealand Based Company, Envirosafe, sold all of its United
States rights to Black & Decker in 2005.  They have received all of these
rights back and now have the number one Mosquito Trap on the market and
have requested our consulting company to exclusive market this product in
North America.
