Samantha Teets

Professional Summary

I grew up moving my entire life, adapting to many different environments
all around the United States. Changed schools almost every two years and
made new friends each time. Experiencing this type of adjustment allowed
myself to gain a positive skill in communication and adapting to new
environments. I would say I am someone who has high expectations for
my results. I am confident in my ability to produce, and while I prepare
for the worst, I do the work necessary to tilt the odds so that the best will
happen. I am also someone who is modest, hard working and consistently
sets firm goals for myself. I take a lot of passion into my performance and I
always exceed the standards of others. I have had previous and current
Assistant manager experience; thus allowed me to undergo new abilities
that I feel can be used or maybe even exceed my skills further.
