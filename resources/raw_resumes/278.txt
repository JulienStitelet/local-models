En couture

February, 2012 -

I have worked for EB Couture for the past 10 years and still work there now. I love the environment and my
clients. I had the ability to make great connections in order for my job to run smoothly. With great organizational
and social skills I was able to accomplish many tasks for the company quicker and more efficient. Over the
years I was even able to collect past debts to the company through a great deal of work and persistence. My
attention to details always caught mistakes that would have costed the business a great deal of money.

I think I have a lot to offer and would love the chance to show you what I can accomplish!
