          Professional Curriculum

         With a degree in English language and a Master's degree in Food and
         Gastronomy, I launched myself into the industrial world by creating my own
         project, namely a pastry shop of salted & sweet products.



         My academic training contributed to the success of my project with my good
         customer communication and the innovation that I brought to my own products
