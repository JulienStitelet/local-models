Experience
[Key Holder, Footwear Manager, Front End Manager| [Kmart] |
[10/2006-01/2014]
During my tenure with America's fourth largest retailer I enjoyed being
challenged in a variety of positions as the needs of the store changed.
I proudly worked my way up within the store ranks as I was promoted from
a front end position, to a sales floor lead position, to working in the
cash office, and finally working as key holder and functioning as the
manager on duty for all shifts.  I was able to supervise a team of 75
employees as we worked to achieve to goals of the business.
Simultaneously,   I personally managed and maintained the highest sales
volume footwear department within the Raleigh market and third highest in
the Southeast Region for 5 consecutive quarters.
[Customer Service Coordinator] | [TJ Maxx] | [05/2003-10/2006]
 Worked as the eyes and ears of the front end, overseeing sales and
 refund transactions, implementing crowd control policies, ensuring
 return merchandise was returned to the sales floor properly and in a
 timely manner.  Worked with management and sales floor leads to create a
 daily schedule that optimized coverage for all key areas.
