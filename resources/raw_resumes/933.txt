To whom this may concern,
I'm Jessica Shea. I just got out of the US ARMY my MOS was an 88M which
was transportation. I learn a lot through out my military career and have
a lot to bring to your company if given the chance. Some of the skills my
other job taught is Communications Skills, Analytical/Research Skills,
Flexibility/Adaptability/Managing Multiple Priorities, Interpersonal
Abilities, Leadership/Management Skills, Multicultural
Sensitivity/Awareness, Planning/Organizing, Problem-Solving/Reasoning/Creativity, Teamwork.
Not only does a employee need to bring skills to a job but I think what makes a good employee is the values they stand behind and some of my values are  Honesty/Integrity/Morality, Adaptability/Flexibility, Dedication/Hard-Working, Dependability/Reliability/Responsibility, Positive Attitude/Motivation/Energy, Professionalism, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn.

Thank you for taking the time to read.
