Hi,
I am easy going, Peers have considered me very caring, passionate, a leader. I have great work
ethic,
I make sure I keep things very organized. I also believe strongly in becoming better at anything I
do.
Any task I can figure it out I don't need to be babysat, which managers appreciate. If I don't have
the
experience yet, do not doubt! I can learn fast and EASILY.

Authorized to work in the US for any employer
