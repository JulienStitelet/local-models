To Whom It May Concern:
My solid sales background, experience in new construction
and other areas of real estate, as well as my success with
management and client service, make me an ideal candidate
for the sales position that you are currently advertising.
Throughout my extensive career, I have proven my
motivation, sales expertise, management and operational
skills. For example, during my time at Easy Street Realty I have:
Consistently been recognized as the top producer within my
firm, and have been asked repeatedly to share my sales process with other agents.
Been awarded as Most Valuable Realtor Partner by Centex
Homes, Beazer Homes, and KB Homes for my consistent number
of net sales provided each year, and was granted a billboard acknowledging such.
Over a 98% client satisfaction rate when asked if I was
knowledgeable, helpful, professional, and understood their needs.
Been recognized for being a leader among my peers, helping
our firm achieve a common purpose and direction, showing
strong organization skills, utilizing all of the tools
available to increase sales and customer satisfaction, and
displaying a necessary positive attitude even when times were tough.

Most of my professional experience has come from the
relationship that I have with the builders in the
Indianapolis area. For over eight years I have developed
strong ties to the builder community and am known as an
extremely professional, knowledgeable, and highly
successful partner of the sales counselors, and of the builders themselves.

Please advise me if you would like a copy of
any reports or documents, and I will supply those immediately.

I would be very excited at the prospect of an interview.
Thank you for your time,

Michael J Burns
