SUMMARY
I have done many construction jobs, such as; operating heavy machinery, operating
  numerous power tools, framing, drywalling, roofing, siding, plumbing,
  installing doors and windows. I have experience also in industrial jobs, such
  as; plastics, bailing, stocking shipping rooms, driving fork lifts, operating
  presses, assembling washing machines, operating machine saws and welding. I
  have many years in carpentry and working in an industrial setting, so I may
  bring a construction company or an industrial company some great attributes. I
  like to stay busy and get the job done right, because I am very dedicated to my
  work.
