Professional Summary:
I am a decisive, innovative and persistent individual with 3+ years in logistics, retail food and
retail clothing. While a Dockworker at Macy's, I helped process merchandise which sped up the
processing stage by 10%. Also while working as a stocker at Walmart, I stocked each item, from box
to shelf, at a rate of 10-15 seconds and with more efficiency.
