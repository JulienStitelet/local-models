Experience

2018- Amazon Fulfillment Center LAS2- Fulfillment Associate
* Began with amazon as a Tier 1 AA in LAS2. I was trained in all indirect functions and was able to
be rotated throughout the
facility, for any function needed.
* Graduated Career Skills, and was given the opportunity to be in a pilot program they launched
called Preparing Associates
to Become Process Assistants. This helped me become a learning ambassador.
* With the "PAPA" program, I was able to be trained as a process assistant, and cover PA's during
breaks or help with the
shift when they were away.
PDX7- Problem Solver
* When PDX7 launched, I became the problem solver for OB Pack. Trained in all areas for that
department and became the
first rebinner of the facility.
* As a problem solver, I had to ensure that every item that did not make it pass a slam station, was
fixed and sent out on
time, to meet customer promise.
* Making sure CPT times were met, by focusing on any items that were dwelling, as well as making
sure I maintained a proper
time management in order to meet these time frames.
* While still being a T1 AA, I was able to create 2 projects to help improve both safety, and
productivity for my department.
PDX7-Process Assistant
* Upon promoting, I was able to help the pick department reduce 10K in DPMO within 3 months.
* I created a coaching guide to help other PA's use specific techniques in their coaching's, to
properly engage with AA's, as
well as help lower the DPMO for their department. I partnered up with an ICQA AM as well as stow, in
order to be able to
provide this guide for other departments as well.
* Ensuring associates had a path set by the time they came in, as well as verified that they had
work for that path.
* Conducting a safety blitz every week to help other department's spot unsafe environments and
behaviors, in order to find
safer ways to approach these.

PDX7- Seasonal AM

* Since becoming a seasonal AM, I created a program called "Drive-Thru Standup" which allows us to
keep our AA's informed
with changes, and continuously give process and safety reminders. This also gives them time to
conduct stretches in a
socially distant way, while improving Fast Start times.
* Since Drive-Thru Standup was launched, injuries and PIT incidents reduced by more than 50%.
* I continuously find ways to help my team succeed, while learning more about the company and the L4
role itself.
* I have also been able to create better communication with my peers, and AA's have taken notice
that now things run more
smoothly from FHN, to BHN. By doing this, it allows us to create a culture where it becomes easier
for donut shift AA's to
have the same flow for both shifts.
* Have helped 2 Tier 1 AA's, get interviews and promote into T3 roles.
* Learned how to run flow for Pick, pack, and dock, and was able to improve my knowledge of the
entire outbound
department.
Hazmat Coordinator
* While in safety, I redesigned the Hazmat cage. This allowed us to process more items weekly,
freeing up our backlog of over
6 months.




* By doing this, we were able to reduce the amount of waste being sent out on a weekly basis by over
2K.
* This also opened up space for the donations process to be set up for the facility which allowed us
to reduce waste by over
3K a week.

JHW1-Area Manager
* Launched a SC-Relo CRETS area in COS5
* Went on 2 months' worth of STA, in order to learn the process of running the site before
launching.
* Trained COS5 learning trainers in PS, in order for them to train our ambassadors, saving the site
time and money having to
send them to another site to train.
* Set up a standard work for EOS handoff, Problem solve and miss-ships.
* Scheduled and lead weekly meetings with my counterparts to discuss updates and maintain
communication through all
shifts.
* Created a Quip for PA's to have easy access to all links needed.
* Created a Critical Role Matrix for easy tracking of AA's being trained in indirect roles across
all shifts, as well as worked with
our program manager, CVG2, and RIC9 to obtain the proper training materials and modules for our AA's
to be trained in.
* Partnered with Learning to obtain training support specifically for JHW1.
* Constantly developing both PA's on my shift with the knowledge I acquired while on STA.
* Created an SOP for the Hazmat area, and partnered with Safety to verify the process.
* Set up a labor tracking kiosk for AA's to scan themselves directly into their critical role after
standup.
* Created checklist and wrote descriptions for each indirect role, in order to help AA's better
understand the functions.
* Helped remove over 1,200 items of IOL that were stagnant after launch.
