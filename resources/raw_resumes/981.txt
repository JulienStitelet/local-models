SUMMARY

I have many years of Airline Maintenance experience in both Management and working as a
technician on various aircraft including the SAAB 2000 . My experience includes dealing with
Flight Crews, Station Managers, Maintenance Reps. Maintenance Control Centers, FAA
Representatives, Stores clerks and AOG desks. During my employment with Primaris Airlines, I
was recommended by the FAA , Mr. Eric Jacobo, Principal Maintenance Inspector, to hold the
position of interim Director of Quality Assurance . This is one of the five key positions
required to maintain a part 121 major airline certificate. (Verification letter available upon
request) I held this position until a permanent Director was approved.

In November 2000, I was awarded the AMT by Ms. Linda Williams, Safety Program Manager
and entered into the 2000 Aviation Maintenance Technician Awards contest.

Having previous experience as a B757 E-Tops Trainer and Manager of the company E-Tops
program, I also assumed duties of Maintenance Training Manager. I feel I can be an asset to
your organization.

In addition to having extensive Aircraft Maintenance experience, I was a small retail business
owner. In owning and operating a business, I gained experience with dealing with the public,
employees, vendors and industry representatives. It enlightened me to appreciate employment
challenges in today's world and to be prepared to thrive in a synergy driven atmosphere.
