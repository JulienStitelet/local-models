I was a call taker and took calls for different roadside assistance for the auto club members. Ten months later, I transferred to auto club branch office in Simi Valley, CA and was assigned to membership services as DMV I & II Specialist where I processed vehicle registrations and California title transfers. I was also a notary and completed other job duties as assigned. Following year, I transferred down the street from my home to the auto club branch office in Camarillo, CA and continued working in membership services as a DMV II & III Specialist where I processed vehicle registrations, in state and also out of state title transfers. The following year, I decided to expand my training and move into the insurance field as an insurance specialist. I was then transferred to the auto club branch office in Thousand Oaks, CA and assigned to insurance department as an insurance specialist. I assisted existing policyholders with their current insurance and/or cancellations. I continued assisting with some membership issues and was assigned as cashier at front desk. In May 2018, I relocated to Texas and was hired by the Texas Policy Management Group to where I continued assisting existing California insurance policyholders, membership services and taking calls for roadside assistance due to high-call volume. This was a high paced call center. I remained in this department until I moved back to California, July 5, 2022 where I was transferred to the auto club Policy Management Group in Los Angeles, CA. I continue doing the same assigned job duties in a high-paced call center until I resigned from this position on July 22, 2022 to pursue different career path.","sk_languages":["English"]}
