This experience has taught me the value and benefit of creating and maintaining good customer relations. In addition, it has helped me to develop and maintain good work habits, which have become a natural and characteristic aspect of who I am. I am motivated to obtain a position in which my acquired skills and work experiences will benefit a new employer. I am open to either a full or part time position for the right opportunity and I look forward to what you may have an interest in discussing with me. Finally, I am dedicated, responsible and willing to put in the extra hours to see any project through to conclusion and I look forward to hopefully hearing from you at your earliest convenience.","sk_languages":["English"]}
